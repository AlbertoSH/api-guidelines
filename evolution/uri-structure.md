# URI Design 

URI is meant to express an **identity of an resource**. 

The API design process **SHOULD NOT** start with the design of URIs. Contrary, the URI should be amongst the last few things added to the API design. 

In adidas URIs are subject to [naming conventions](https://adidas-group.gitbooks.io/api-guidelines/content/evolution/naming-conventions.html).

To read more about the problematics refer to [RFC 7320: URI Design and Ownership](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7320).
