# API design platform - Apiary
1. [Apiary](https://apiary.io/) is the primary platform supporting [API first approach](./api-first.md). Apiary MUST be used during API Design.
1. Every API description MUST be stored in [Apiary](https://apiary.io/) under the ADIDAS GROUP team. 
1. Apiary MUST be the **single source of truth** to learn about existing APIs within the organization.
 
> NOTE: API first approach is crucial when adopting the Microservice architecture.  
 Describing what API is supposed to do also helps all stakeholders to align and better understand what will be delivered at the end.
 It's not acceptable that API is developed first and later on described in some proprietary format.
