# API First

1. Development of an API MUST always start with API design. 
1. An API design MUST be formalized in a form of an API description using **Swagger** and stored in [Apiary](./apiary.md).
1. API description is master of truth, not the API implementation.
1. API design SHOULD be realized following the **API design process**


> NOTE: API first approach is critical for adopting the Microservice architecture.  


API design needs to be agreed with stakeholders
