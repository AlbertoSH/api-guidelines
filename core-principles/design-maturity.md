# Design Maturity
Every API design MUST be resource-centric ([Web API Design Maturity Model Level 2](http://amundsen.com/talks/2016-11-apistrat-wadm/2016-11-apistrat-wadm.pdf)). That is an API design MUST revolve around HTTP-styled resources, relations between the resources and actions the resources afford. 

An API design MAY be affordance-centric ([Web API Design Maturity Model Level 3](http://amundsen.com/talks/2016-11-apistrat-wadm/2016-11-apistrat-wadm.pdf)).
