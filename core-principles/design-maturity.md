# Design Maturity
Every API design MUST be **resource-centric** ([Web API Design Maturity Model Level 2](http://amundsen.com/talks/2016-11-apistrat-wadm/2016-11-apistrat-wadm.pdf)). That is an API design MUST revolve around Web-styled **resources**, **relations** between the resources and the **actions** the resources might afford. 

An API design MAY be **affordance-centric** ([Web API Design Maturity Model Level 3](http://amundsen.com/talks/2016-11-apistrat-wadm/2016-11-apistrat-wadm.pdf)).
