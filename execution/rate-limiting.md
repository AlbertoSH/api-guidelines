# Rate Limiting
The API rate limiting is provided by the selected adidas API management platform â€“ Mashery. 

Rate limit informations are provided in the for of HTTP headers. There are two types of rate limits: **Quota** and **Throttle**. Quota is a limit enforced per a longer period (typically a day). Throttle is the limit of calls per second. 

## Quota Limit
The limit on the number of call per a period (day). The default quota limit is "unlimited". 

#### Example 
Example response to a request over the quota limit: 

```
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Content-Type: text/xml

X-Error-Detail-Header: Account Over Rate Limit
X-Mashery-Error-Code: ERR_403_DEVELOPER_OVER_RATE

<h1>Developer Over Rate</h1>
```

## Throttle Limit
The limit on the number of call per second. The default throttle limit is 1000 calls per second. 

#### Example
Example response to a request over the throttle limit:

```
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Content-Type: text/xml

Retry-After: 1
X-Error-Detail-Header: Account Over Queries Per Second Limit
X-Mashery-Error-Code: ERR_403_DEVELOPER_OVER_QPS

<h1>Developer Over Qps</h1>
```

> NOTE: The `Retry-After` gives a hint how long before the same request should be repeated (in seconds).

By default the headers do not contain details about the current usage and quotas. This can be changed in the API management:
