This document represents the guidelines for all APIs created the within adidas group. 

## Motivation
The ultimate goal of these guidelines is to facilitate the work and minimize the effort of all API users while protecting their investment, thus encouraging API adoption.

The guidelines should lay down the foundation for collaboration, achieving stability without rigidity while maintaining extensibility for the future.

## Guidelines
The API Guidelines are split into several levels:

The **Core Principles** define the general rules that MUST be followed at throughout the full API lifecycle at any level. **Protocol guidelines** define the protocols used within the organization. The **Message guidelines** define the structure and semantics of messages used to exchange information. The **Application guidelines** define the definition and use of application-specific semantics. Finally, **Evolution and Execution guidelines** define the rules for achieving the desired architectural qualities of systems.
